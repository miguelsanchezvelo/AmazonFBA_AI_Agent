# AmazonFBA AI Agent

This repository contains a simple script to discover potential Amazon FBA product opportunities using [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/).

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv google-search-results openai
   ```
   The SerpAPI client is imported in the code as `from serpapi import GoogleSearch`.
   If you previously installed the wrong package, you can remove it with:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall serpapi
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your SerpAPI API key. Optionally copy
   `config.example.json` to `config.json` to store both SerpAPI and Keepa keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env and set SERPAPI_API_KEY
   cp config.example.json config.json  # edit and set KEEPPA/SerpAPI keys
   ```

## Usage
Run the discovery script and enter your total startup budget when prompted.
The script reserves part of that budget for tools and subscriptions (the amount is controlled by the `FIXED_COST` constant in `product_discovery.py`) and uses the rest for product research. The discovery step queries Amazon directly using SerpAPI's Amazon engine:


```bash
python product_discovery.py [--debug]
```

The script searches several product categories, estimates profitability, and saves the top 20 opportunities in `data/product_results.csv`. Use the optional `--debug` flag to print raw SerpAPI results for troubleshooting.

## Market Analysis
To analyze the market potential of existing Amazon products by ASIN, run the
`market_analysis.py` script. You can enter one or more ASINs when prompted or
provide a CSV file containing an `asin` column via the `--csv` option. If you
press **Enter** without typing any ASINs, the script will automatically load the
values from `data/product_results.csv` created by `product_discovery.py`. The
The script fetches pricing, rating, review count, and best seller rank. It uses
SerpAPI as the primary source and falls back to Keepa when necessary. You can
disable keyword-based fallback searches with the `--no-fallback` flag. Results
are saved to `data/market_analysis_results.csv`.

```bash
python market_analysis.py
```


## Offline Mock Data
If you want to experiment without valid API keys, run `prepare_mock_data.py`.
It creates `data/mock_market_data.csv` with sample products and skips creation
if the file already exists or API credentials are detected.

## Supplier Quote Messages
The `generate_supplier_messages.py` script sends each product in
`data/supplier_contact_requests.json` to the OpenAI Chat API and saves the
resulting emails to `data/supplier_messages.json`. Set your OpenAI key in `.env`
as `OPENAI_API_KEY` before running:

```bash
python generate_supplier_messages.py
```

## Email Negotiation Agent
The `negotiation_agent.py` script connects to a Gmail inbox, summarizes unread supplier emails and optionally sends replies with GPT‚Äë4. Configure `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file. Enable automatic sending by setting `AUTO_REPLY=True`.

Run it manually with:
```bash
python negotiation_agent.py
```
It is also executed automatically by `fba_agent.py` when credentials are present.

## Email Manager
`email_manager.py` extends the automated workflow by keeping track of entire conversation threads. It connects to the same inbox using IMAP and SMTP, detects replies from suppliers and, if `AUTO_REPLY=True`, generates responses with OpenAI and sends them automatically. All processed threads are stored in `logs/email_threads.json`.

Run it manually with:
```bash
python email_manager.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to resolve Git conflicts

When working on different branches, you might encounter conflicts when merging. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to resolve them safely:

### ‚úÖ Steps

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2. Switch to your working branch:

```bash
git checkout your-feature-branch
```

3. Merge the latest changes from main into your branch:

```bash
git merge main
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If conflicts appear, Git will mark them in your files.

4. Open the files with conflict. You‚Äôll see markers like:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Incoming changes from main
>>>>>>> main
```

Edit and decide which version to keep (or combine both), then save.

5. After resolving, stage the file:

```bash
git add file_with_conflict.py
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict with main"
```

6. Push your branch:

```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

### üí° Tips

- Use an editor like VS Code to resolve conflicts visually.
- Run `git status` to check progress and remaining conflicts.
- Avoid resolving conflicts in non-code editors like Notepad.

## ‚úÖ Auto-Fix & Git Auto-Commit

The `fba_agent.py` script now includes an optional mechanism to validate, fix, and auto-commit changes to the repository using Git.

### How It Works

1. **Validation Step**:
   - Runs `validate_all.py` to check if all scripts work correctly (compilation, imports, CLI help, etc.).

2. **Auto-Fix Step**:
   - If validation fails and `--auto-fix` is used, `fba_agent.py` triggers Codex to automatically fix the broken modules.

3. **Git Auto-Commit**:
   - After the fix, the agent:
     - Detects the current Git branch.
     - Adds all changes: `git add .`
     - Commits them: `git commit -m "fix: auto-corrected validation errors"`
     - Pushes to the same branch: `git push origin [branch]`

4. **Logs**:
   - All actions (fixes, validation, git output) are recorded in `log.txt`.

### Requirements

- Local Git installation (`git` must be in your system PATH).
- Authenticated access to your GitHub repository (via HTTPS token or SSH).
- Internet connection to access Codex/OpenAI API.

### Example

```bash
python fba_agent.py --auto --auto-fix
```

This command runs the pipeline without user prompts, fixes any broken code, and commits the results automatically if needed.

Use `--validate-only` to run only the validation report:

```bash
python fba_agent.py --validate-only
```

### Notes

- If Git is not configured or an error occurs, a warning will be shown but the process continues.
- You are encouraged to review changes using GitHub or `git diff` before deploying to production.

## üõ† Resetting the pipeline

If the validation report indicates critical errors (e.g., missing files or inconsistent ASINs),
you can reset the project by running:

```bash
python reset_pipeline.py
```
This will clear all generated outputs so the next run starts clean.
